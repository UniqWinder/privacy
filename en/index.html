        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: February 23, 2026</em></p>

        <p>Thank you for using <strong>Uniq Winders</strong>. This privacy policy informs you about how the Uniq Winders mobile application and associated physical product (connected watch winder) handle your data.</p>
        <p><strong>Uniq Winders</strong> is published by a Swiss company and complies with the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (nFADP), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for European Union and European Economic Area users, and applicable U.S. privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA).</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>2. Collection and Use of Information</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No user account required:</strong> Using the application does not require creating an account or providing personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical device identifier:</strong> Each watch winder has a unique identifier generated by cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) of the electronic component's MAC address, combined with a random salt. <strong>This identifier cannot be reversed to the original MAC address</strong> due to the one-way nature of the hash. It is used exclusively for technical communications (parameter synchronization, firmware updates). <strong>This identifier is not considered personal data</strong> as it is not linked to any identifiable person and does not allow any profiling or user tracking.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>IoT Features (voluntary activation):</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>The application communicates with our cloud infrastructure hosted in Switzerland to provide certain IoT features (remote control, parameter synchronization).</li>
                <li>These services are only activated if the user explicitly chooses to enable them in the application after reading and accepting the IoT consent dialog.</li>
                <li>Data transmitted is exclusively technical: winder identifier, battery level (in millivolts), rotation parameters (number of turns, interval, direction, speed), and firmware version.</li>
                <li>No personal, behavioral, or personally identifiable data is collected or transmitted.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Wi-Fi connection:</strong> If you choose to connect your winder to your Wi-Fi network, the network name (SSID) is stored locally on the device. The Wi-Fi password is handled internally by the device's wireless module for automatic reconnection and is protected by hardware flash encryption (AES-256). <strong>The Wi-Fi password is never transmitted to our servers.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> The application does not include any analytics SDK, advertising tracker, or behavioral profiling tool. No advertising identifier is collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimal permissions:</strong> The application only requests Bluetooth permission, necessary for communicating with your winder. No location, camera, microphone, or storage permissions are required.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>3. Device Security Architecture</h2>
          <p>Your Uniq Winders watch winder incorporates a professional-grade multi-layered security architecture:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bluetooth (BLE) communication:</strong> All Bluetooth communications use the Secure Connections protocol with pairing and bonding. Sensitive characteristics (parameters, Wi-Fi credentials, OTA updates) are protected by link-layer encryption and are only accessible to paired devices. Pairing requires physical interaction with the device, preventing any remote bonding attempt.</li>
            <li><strong>Data encryption at rest:</strong> The device firmware is protected by hardware flash encryption (AES-256). Secrets stored in non-volatile memory are also encrypted. No sensitive data is readable even with physical access to the electronic component.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Boot:</strong> Each device startup verifies firmware authenticity through a cryptographic signature. Only firmware signed by Uniq Winders can run on the device.</li>
            <li><strong>Unique per-device secrets:</strong> Each winder possesses a unique 256-bit cryptographic secret generated during manufacturing. This secret is used for server authentication and update encryption. Compromising one device does not compromise any other.</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-rollback protection:</strong> A hardware counter prevents installation of an earlier firmware version, protecting against downgrade attacks.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>4. Firmware Updates (OTA)</h2>
          <p>Firmware updates benefit from a four-layer protection system:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Encrypted BLE transport:</strong> Update data travels via Bluetooth Low Energy between your phone and the winder over an encrypted connection after pairing.</li>
            <li><strong>Unique key encryption (AES-256):</strong> The firmware is encrypted server-side using the AES-256 algorithm with your device's unique secret and a random 16-byte nonce generated for each update. Only your device can decrypt the update intended for it.</li>
            <li><strong>Signature verification:</strong> After decryption, the device's secure bootloader verifies the cryptographic signature of the firmware. Any malicious modification is detected and the firmware rejected.</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-rollback protection:</strong> The hardware counter prevents any downgrade to a previous firmware version.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Functional updates are offered to the user who can choose whether to install them. Critical security updates may be strongly recommended.</li>
            <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> In case of issues during an update, a protection mechanism preserves device functionality.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>5. Software Support Duration</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintenance commitment:</strong> In accordance with the European Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), we commit to providing security updates for your product for a minimum period of <strong>5 years</strong> from the date of purchase, or until December 31, 2031 at minimum.</li>
            <li><strong>Functional updates:</strong> Functional improvements may be offered beyond this period, without obligation on our part.</li>
            <li><strong>Offline operation:</strong> Your winder remains fully functional even without Internet connection or updates, using locally stored settings.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>6. Data Sharing and Technical Infrastructure</h2>
